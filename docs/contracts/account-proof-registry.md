# Account Proof Registry

## Simple Summary

A registry for account proof management.

## Motivation

Given the fact, there is no way to sign the data using a contract based wallet, we created a registry to store signed by the key wallet proofs. 

*Note: [ERC-1271 (Standard Signature Validation Method for Contracts)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1271) 
allows removing a signer after the signature was created. Thus store the signature for the later use doesn't guarantee the signer is still has access to that smart account.
Because of that, the ERC1271's `isValidSignature()` cannot be used in e.g. `PaymentRegistry`.*

## Definitions

* account - contract or key based wallet,
* hash - unique in account scope `bytes32` data,
* proof - information that account added hash,

## Specification

`AccountProofRegistry` has the following interface:

```solidity
interface AccountProofRegistry {
  // events

  event AccountProofAdded(
    address account,
    bytes32 hash
  );

  event AccountProofRemoved(
    address account,
    bytes32 hash
  );

  // external functions

  function addAccountProof(
    bytes32 hash
  )
    external;

  function removeAccountProof(
    bytes32 hash
  )
    external;

  // external functions (views)

  function verifyAccountProof(
    address account,
    bytes32 hash
  )
    external
    view
    returns (bool);

  function verifyAccountProofAtBlock(
    address account,
    bytes32 hash,
    uint256 blockNumber
  )
    external
    view
    returns (bool);
}
```

### Account proof management

Account can call the registry to add (`addAccountProof`) or remove (`removeAccountProof`) own proofs. 
When proof has been added, information about that fact will live in registry forever.
Removing proof only affects future blocks (until proof is re-added).

### Account proof verification

Account proof can be verified in a current block (`verifyAccountProof`) or in previous (`verifyAccountProofAtBlock`) 
using `blockNumber` argument.
