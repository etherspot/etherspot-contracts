 * @dev Interface of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in

 *
 * Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by
 * presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't
 * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.

     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction
     * ordering also apply here.

     * Requirements:
     *

     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`
     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.
     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).
