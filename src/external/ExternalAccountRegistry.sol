/**
 * @title External account registry
 *
 * @notice Global registry for keys and external (outside of the platform) contract based wallets
 *
 * @dev An account can call the registry to add (`addAccountOwner`) or remove (`removeAccountOwner`) its own owners.
 * When the owner has been added, information about that fact will live in the registry forever.
 * Removing an owner only affects the future blocks (until the owner is re-added).
 *
 * Given the fact, there is no way to sign the data using a contract based wallet,
 * we created a registry to store signed by the key wallet proofs.
 * ERC-1271 allows removing a signer after the signature was created. Thus store the signature for the later use
 * doesn't guarantee the signer is still has access to that smart account.
 * Because of that, the ERC1271's `isValidSignature()` cannot be used in e.g. `PaymentRegistry`.*
 *
 * An account can call the registry to add (`addAccountProof`) or remove (`removeAccountProof`) proof hash.
 * When the proof has been added, information about that fact will live in the registry forever.
 * Removing a proof only affects the future blocks (until the proof is re-added).
